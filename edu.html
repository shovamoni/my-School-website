            Education system in Bangladesh
            The district-based Boards of Intermediate and Secondary Education in Bangladesh manage the country's three-tiered education system at the primary, secondary and higher secondary level. They are responsible for conducting the examinations for the Secondary School Certificate (S.S.C), the Higher Secondary (School) Certificate (H.S.C) level public examinations. The boards are also responsible for the recognition of private sector educational institutes.[1][2]
